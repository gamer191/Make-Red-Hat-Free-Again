Subject: [PATCH] remote_driver: Restore special behavior of
 remoteDomainGetBlockIoTune()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In v9.10.0-rc1~103 the remote driver was switched to g_auto() for
client RPC return parameters. But whilst doing so a small bug
slipped in: previously, when virDomainGetBlockIoTune() was called
with *nparams == 0, the function set *nparams to the number of
supported params and zero was returned (so that client can
allocate memory and call the API second time). IOW - the usual,
old style of APIs where we didn't want to allocate memory on
caller's behalf. But because of this bug, a negative one is
returned instead.
