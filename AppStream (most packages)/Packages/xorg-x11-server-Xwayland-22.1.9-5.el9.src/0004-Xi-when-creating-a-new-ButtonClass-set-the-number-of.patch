Subject: [PATCH xserver 4/9] Xi: when creating a new ButtonClass, set the
 number of buttons

There's a racy sequence where a master device may copy the button class
from the slave, without ever initializing numButtons. This leads to a
device with zero buttons but a button class which is invalid.

Let's copy the numButtons value from the source - by definition if we
don't have a button class yet we do not have any other slave devices
with more than this number of buttons anyway.

CVE-2024-0229, ZDI-CAN-22678

This vulnerability was discovered by:
Jan-Niklas Sohn working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative

(cherry picked from commit df3c65706eb169d5938df0052059f3e0d5981b74)
