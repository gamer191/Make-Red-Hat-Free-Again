 Very useful parameter is -c (or cmd_prompt in stdin mode). This must be set to something, what is displayed after successful login to host machine. Default string is space on end of string (default for root in bash). But (for example) csh use ], so in that case you must use parameter -c with argument ]. Very similar situation is, if you use bash and login to host machine with other user than root. Than prompt is $, so again, you must use parameter -c.</longdesc>

 The fence_scsi agent works by having each node in the cluster register a unique key with the SCSI device(s). Reservation key is generated from "node id" (default) or from "node name hash" (RECOMMENDED) by adjusting "key_value" option. Using hash is recommended to prevent issues when removing nodes from cluster without full cluster restart. Once registered, a single node will become the reservation holder by creating a "write exclusive, registrants only" reservation on the device(s). The result is that only registered nodes may write to the device(s). When a node failure occurs, the fence_scsi agent will remove the key belonging to the failed node from the device(s). The failed node will no longer be able to write to the device(s). A manual reboot is required.
