Subject: [PATCH] EditTextObjectImpl copy ctor doesn't exactly copy
 EditTextObjectImpl
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

and this is apparently relied on, so eliding the copy gives unexpected
results.

EditTextObjectImpl::Clone returns a copy of *this, but the
EditTextObjectImpl copy ctor explicitly does not copy the "PortionInfo"
member, so in:

    ofz#23492 the only user of this ctor throws away the original of the clone

    so we can take ownership of the original instead

where the copy was optimized away we want from a state where there was a
new EditTextObjectImpl with an empty PortionInfo member to one where the
PortionInfo of the EditTextObjectImpl was retained.

So explicitly clear this unwanted info.

It's very hard to make rational judgements about code if a copy behaves
differently than the orignal :-(
