When the property is a hex string ('aa:bb:cc') it is interpreted as a binary client ID, in which case the first byte is assumed to be the 'type' field as per RFC 2132 section 9.14 and the remaining bytes may be an hardware address (e.g. '01:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx' where 1 is the Ethernet ARP type and the rest is a MAC address). If the property is not a hex string it is considered as a non-hardware-address client ID and the 'type' field is set to 0. The special values \"mac\" and \"perm-mac\" are supported, which use the current or permanent MAC address of the device to generate a client identifier with type ethernet (01). Currently, these options only work for ethernet type of links. The special value \"ipv6-duid\" uses the DUID from \"ipv6.dhcp-duid\" property as an RFC4361-compliant client identifier. As IAID it uses \"ipv4.dhcp-iaid\" and falls back to \"ipv6.dhcp-iaid\" if unset. The special value \"duid\" generates a RFC4361-compliant client identifier based on \"ipv4.dhcp-iaid\" and uses a DUID generated by hashing /etc/machine-id. The special value \"stable\" is supported to generate a type 0 client identifier based on the stable-id (see connection.stable-id) and a per-host key. If you set the stable-id, you may want to include the \"${DEVICE}\" or \"${MAC}\" specifier to get a per-device key. The special value \"none\" prevents any client identifier from being sent. Note that this is normally not recommended. If unset, a globally configured default from NetworkManager.conf is used. If still unset, the default depends on the DHCP plugin.

 #define DESCRIBE_DOC_NM_SETTING_IP6_CONFIG_ADDR_GEN_MODE N_("Configure method for creating the IPv6 interface identifer of addresses with RFC4862 IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration and Link Local addresses. The permitted values are: \"eui64\" (0), \"stable-privacy\" (1), \"default\" (3) or \"default-or-eui64\" (2). If the property is set to \"eui64\", the addresses will be generated using the interface token derived from hardware address. This makes the host part of the address to stay constant, making it possible to track the host's presence when it changes networks. The address changes when the interface hardware is replaced. If a duplicate address is detected, there is also no fallback to generate another address. When configured, the \"ipv6.token\" is used instead of the MAC address to generate addresses for stateless autoconfiguration. If the property is set to \"stable-privacy\", the interface identifier is generated as specified by RFC7217. This works by hashing a host specific key (see NetworkManager(8) manual), the interface name, the connection's \"connection.stable-id\" property and the address prefix.  This improves privacy by making it harder to use the address to track the host's presence and the address is stable when the network interface hardware is replaced. The special values \"default\" and \"default-or-eui64\" will fallback to the global connection default as documented in the NetworkManager.conf(5) manual. If the global default is not specified, the fallback value is \"stable-privacy\" or \"eui64\", respectively. If not specified, when creating a new profile the default is \"default\".

The DUID is carried in the Client Identifier option. If the property is a hex string ('aa:bb:cc') it is interpreted as a binary DUID and filled as an opaque value in the Client Identifier option. The special value \"lease\" will retrieve the DUID previously used from the lease file belonging to the connection. If no DUID is found and \"dhclient\" is the configured dhcp client, the DUID is searched in the system-wide dhclient lease file. If still no DUID is found, or another dhcp client is used, a global and permanent DUID-UUID (RFC 6355) will be generated based on the machine-id. The special values \"llt\" and \"ll\" will generate a DUID of type LLT or LL (see RFC 3315) based on the current MAC address of the device. In order to try providing a stable DUID-LLT, the time field will contain a constant timestamp that is used globally (for all profiles) and persisted to disk. The special values \"stable-llt\", \"stable-ll\" and \"stable-uuid\" will generate a DUID of the corresponding type, derived from the connection's stable-id and a per-host unique key. You may want to include the \"${DEVICE}\" or \"${MAC}\" specifier in the stable-id, in case this profile gets activated on multiple devices. So, the link-layer address of \"stable-ll\" and \"stable-llt\" will be a generated address derived from the stable id. The DUID-LLT time value in the \"stable-llt\" option will be picked among a static timespan of three years (the upper bound of the interval is the same constant timestamp used in \"llt\").
